# CP Field Inspect plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

CP Field Inspect is a tiny utility plugin making content modelling a little bit easier in Craft.  

Did you forget a field handle? Mouse over the cogwheel next to the field title, and CP Field Inspect will tell you.  

Need to adjust some field settings? Click the cogwheel; CP Field Inspect will redirect you to the relevant field's settings page – and back to the content when you're done.  

Additionally, CP Field Inspect will add a link in your element edit forms to manage source settings (e.g. entry type, category group) in the same manner.  

Note that CP Field Inspect will only be active for **admin** users.
